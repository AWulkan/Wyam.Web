There are a number of [examples of Wyam sites in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wyamio/Wyam/tree/master/Examples). They are designed to showcase different modules and techniques.

You can also look at the [code for this site](https://github.com/Wyamio/Wyam.Web) which is a great example of using Wyam in the wild. Specifically take a look to see how the navigation for the documentation pages is generated.
