There are a number of [examples of Wyam sites in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wyamio/Wyam/tree/master/Examples). They are designed to showcase different modules and techniques.

There are also a number of sites that use Wyam and have source code available:
  - [wyam.io](http://wyam.io) ([source code](https://github.com/Wyamio/Wyam.Web)) Specifically take a look to see how the navigation for the documentation pages is generated.
  - [daveaglick.com](http://daveaglick.com) ([source code](https://github.com/DaveAGlick/DaveAGlick)) A good example of creating a blog with Wyam.
  
If you have a site that's generated by Wyam, and especially if the source code is available, please let us know by opening an issue or (even better) submitting a pull request adding it to this page.
