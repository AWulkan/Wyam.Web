  *Wyam* is a Native American name for the [Celilo Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celilo_Falls) area and is also roughly translated as "echo of falling water" or "sound of water upon the rocks". Which sounds kind of like static. For a static site generator. Get it? I also liked the image of water going over the falls as one thing then going through a transition as it emerged at the bottom as something else. Plus the name just sounds cool, and the domain was available.
