Note that this list isn't exhaustive. Some modules used by the recipe may have their own global metadata that you can set as well.


---
While it's not required, it's recommended that you create a configuration file to define the `Host` setting and the following global metadata:

* `Title` - The title of the site, used in several places including the web page title.
* `Description` - The description of the site used on the home page.
* `Intro` - A small introduction paragraph used on the home page.

A configuration file that defines these would look something like:

```
Settings.Host = "example.com";
GlobalMetadata["Title"] = "Dave Glick";
GlobalMetadata["Description"] = "The personal blog of Dave Glick";
GlobalMetadata["Intro"] = "Hi, welcome to my blog!";
```
