Note that this list isn't exhaustive. Some modules used by the recipe may have their own document metadata that you can set as well.

Each document and/or post can also define some metadata (usually in front matter).

* `Title` - The title of the page or post.
* `Lead` - A short introduction sentence about the page or post.
* `Image` - A link (relative or absolute) to a large hero image that should be displayed on the page.
* `Published` - The date the post was published.
* `Tags` - A list of tags for the post.
* `ShowInNavbar` - A true/false value indicating whether the page should be shown in the top navigation bar.

The front matter for a post might look something like this:

```
Title: First Post
Lead: This is my first post to my blog.
