# Creating A New Theme

In addition to the general [theme creation instructions](/docs/extensibility/creating-a-theme), each recipe has specific requirements about what pages the theme must contain. This recipe requires the following pages to be present in the theme:

* `index.cshtml`  
  The home page for the site.

* `_Layout.cshtml`
  The main layout for the theme including the HTML header, scripts, etc.

* `_Archive.cshtml`
  The template for the main archive page.

* `_Tags.cshtml`
  The main tag index listing all the tags.

* `_Tag.cshtml`
  The template for each individual tag listing all of the posts for that tag.

* `_PostLayout.cshtml`
  The layout applied to each post (this is separate from the primary layout to allow for post-specific features like commenting systems).

A theme will probably also have many files that aren't required, but it must have these ones at a minimum.
