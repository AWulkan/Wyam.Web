Just because you're running a static site doesn't mean that the experience can't be rich for your users. A lot of third-parties have been filling in for traditional server-side roles with easy to embed JavaScript widgets that run on the client. Here are some of our favorites. Please suggest additional resources if you know of any.

- **[Eager](https://eager.io/)**: platform for easily adding libraries and services to your static site.

- **[Formspree](http://formspree.io/)**: forms via email.

- **[Brisk Forms](https://www.briskforms.com/)**: free and open source forms via email that keeps your email address private.
