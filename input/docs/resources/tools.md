Just because you're running a static site doesn't mean that the experience can't be rich for your users. A lot of JavaScript components, hosted services, and other resources are available to support static sites where more traditional server-side infrastructure would otherwise be required. While some tools are targeted at specific static generators, many are generator agnostic and can be leveraged to enhance your Wyam site.

Here are some of our favorites. Please suggest additional resources if you know of any that aren't listed here. Some other good places to look are [The New Dynamic](https://www.thenewdynamic.org/tools/) and the list of [Awesome Static Website Services](https://github.com/aharris88/awesome-static-website-services). Also make sure to check out the [list of static site hosts](/docs/resources/hosts) for services designed to host your static sites.
